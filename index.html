      <p> These pages contain links and descriptions of the software created and/or maintained by the Biomedical Image Analysis group of A.I. Virtanen Institute for Molecular Sciences of the University of Eastern Finland. </p>
    <p> <a href=https://www.nitrc.org/projects/isc-toolbox/ISC-Toolbox"> <h3> ISC Toolbox </h3> </a>. This is a toolbox to perform inter-subject correlation based analysis of fmri data in Matlab as well as a 
        GUI for the visualization of the analysis results. The toolbox contains various functions to carry out the inter-subject 
        correlation (ISC) analysis, which can be run from a GUI. A set of visualization tools - particularly designed for ISC analyses 
        - are intergrated to the GUI. Visualization tools contain functionalities to which standard functional neuroimaging packages were 
        difficult to adapt.
